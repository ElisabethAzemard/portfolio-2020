                                                    There I had it, my preconceived notions were confirmed. I thought I had my topic, "The blockchain, umpteenth example of inequalities in technology". Except that there were already a lot of articles on the subject. Looking a little further, I came across Claire Balva's TEDx, which explains the stakes of the blockchain and how it could change our
                                                    relationships in society.

                                                <p>
                                                    That's when my somewhat unsteady thinking began to dangerously sway. It finished collapsing when I attended a master class by Quentin de Beauchesne on blockchain and bitcoin.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    For one thing, because by the end of the lecture, I had figured it out. I have no plans to create my own Bitcoin, nor to become an expert in blockchain. But I understood, and more importantly, I find the subject fascinating because of the range of possible applications. In a (very small) nutshell, blockchain is a system for storing and transmitting
                                                    value (money, votes, etc.) in a secure and transparent way. The first use we know of it, with crypto-currencies, is therefore only the tip of the iceberg. It is a real technological revolution that opens up a new realm of possibilities.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    On the other hand, because I remembered a polemic in the AI field. We've seen sexist, even racist biases emerge because the people who design these interfaces are... men. I thought I could use this example to illustrate the potential dangers of a gender imbalance in the development of a technology.
                                                </p>
                                                <h5 class="subtitle is-uppercase">The blockchain, good student of tech</h5>
                                                <p>
                                                    Except that, in fact, the blockchain in essence has a strong potential to abolish inequalities.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    It is based on decentralisation and the elimination of intermediaries. In an ideal world, this would allow the value created by users to be redistributed among themselves instead of being taken over by the intermediaries who coordinate them. All links in the chain are equally important.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, is himself a great mystery. "He" claims to be a man, Japanese, 43 years old. In reality, we know nothing about this, or these people. He thus seems to suggest that it doesn't matter whether he is a man, a woman or an alien. Without a face, without an identity known beyond their name, they are a bit of a symbol of a world where age, ethnicity or gender no longer have a place as discrimination factors.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    If inequalities between individuals in general are erased, perhaps gender inequalities will therefore not only no longer have any place, but will no longer even be a subject for discussion.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    In the end, the blockchain may well be the right student of tech. The problem is not related to the blockchain in particular, but rather to tech in general. And maybe if we spent less time pointing fingers than encouraging everyone interested in a technology to develop it, we would have less time to wonder whether or not this or that inequality still
                                                    persists.

                                                There are a number of sources that mention open source design, or open design. There is a site with a promising
                                                name, the Open-Design Foundation. Wikipedia devotes an article to it, the Open-design movement. Any designer is probably able to mention at least five or six sites of royalty-free graphic resources.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                But if you take a closer look, the Open-Design Foundation is not very active (the last article on the site dates back to 2015) and mainly offers some thoughts on the subject. The Wikipedia article does not talk about web design or graphic design but only about industrial and object design. Last but not least, the resources that can be found on the Internet (icons, photographs, logos) are "ready to use" and are to design what freewares were to software before the arrival of Linux and later open source as a philosophy. It's more about access to content than a real movement that would have the ambition to make progress design and graphic design as a discipline or at least to bring people to collaborate.

                                                At first glance it seems astonishing that the people behind open source are the least sociable species on the planet: developers. And yet, they have created a real movement based on data sharing and group work.

                                                Conversely, designers and other creatives are known to work together, through group brainstormings and multitudes of Post-It's stuck on walls, and yet... Yet the most common topic on the Internet regarding the work of creatives is the protection of their work. For or against watermarks? Would they have to disfigure their work to prevent it from being stolen, copied or re-sold, most of the time not only without their consent, but often without them knowing about it?

                                                The arrival of open source has greatly worried companies that until then had a monopoly. Today, creative people have the same concern. They fear that their work loses value if it is used by others. If open source has demonstrated one thing, it is that it's not an impoverishment, but an enrichment of the discipline. But then, why is it that while the Open Source Initiative is celebrating its twentieth anniversary, design hasn't learned from development? It has much to learn from a functioning that encourages progress, at a time when innovation is increasingly marginal. Why is it that we spend more time worrying about what our work will become than we do about creating, collaborating and making progress?

                                                It seems to me that the answer lies in one sentence: project-final-V10-done-LAST.svg. Applying the open source
                                                philosophy to design will only be possible once we stop opposing design and development. When we stop considering that a "real" development project is necessarily repulsive in terms of UI, and that a designer is necessarily disorganized. When will encourage designers, developers and creative people in general to work hand in hand to increase their own skills, but also to imagine together the design and technologies of tomorrow.

                                            <p>
                                                Designers are missing something essential for that: a tool that allows them to leave behind their misnamed files and eventually their unsightly watermarks. There is now a versioning tool for designers, Abstract, which prototypr.io explains very well in its article on the subject. It allows you to version your projects and synchronize them with Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket, without having to master the terminal commands. The problem is that it is currently only usable with Sketch, and therefore only available on Mac OS. There go ideals of an open source world. However, the project started in 2017 and we can hope that it will evolve in the coming months and years to allow other types of files to be synchronized.

                                                The path of open design is open and just waiting to be taken. So, who will dedicate themselves to create a true
                                                designer's Git? And why not you? Why not me? Why not us?</p>
